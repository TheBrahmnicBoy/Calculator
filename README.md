## â†  Why

Made for the Java course as a part of the **Computer Engineering Course** of University of Mumbai, which teaches about Java applets and Java swing features. Although deprecated, those frameworks were fun to fiddle around with and helped understand how event listeners and handlers worked. 

## â†  How to run

Run `main.sh` to compile and run the applet. Make sure you have the JDK installed.

## â†  Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.1 or higher
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.1 or higher
- A terminal to run the shell script

| `SQ`         | Gives the square root of the number in the display, but gives an error if it isn't a number. |
| `1/x`        | Gives the reciprocal of a number.                                                            |
| `%`          | Gives the number divided by 100.                                                             |
| `MC`         | Memory clear. It clears the memory.                                                          |
| `MR`         | Memory recall. It fills the display with the contents of the memory.                         |
| `MS`         | Memory save. It saves the number on the display into the memory.                             |
