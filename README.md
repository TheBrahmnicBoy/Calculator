## Why

The college I am studying at has a Java course, which teaches about Java applets and Java swing features. Although deprecated, those frameworks were fun to fiddle around with and helped understand how event listeners and handlers worked. 

## How to run

Run `main.sh` to compile and run the applet. Make sure you have the JDK installed.

### Functions 

- Enter Numbers using the numpad.
- Enter deicmal point using the '.' key.
- "<-" is backspace, and works the same as "CE", both of which delete one element from the right.
- "C" clears the display.
- "SQ" gives the square root of number in display, but gives an error if it isn't a number.
- "1/x" gives the reciprocal of a number
- "%" gives the number divided by 100
- "MC" is memory clear. It clears the memory.
- "MR" is memory recall. It fills the display with the contents of the memory.
- "MS" is memory save. It saves the number on the display into the memory.
- "M+" and "M-" add/subtract the number in diplay from memory.

Prof. Sandeep Raskar, Terna Engineering College, for providing the swing template to work with.
I only made a few tweaks and implemented all the interactiveness.
